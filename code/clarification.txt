(4) Due to the large size of the bb.bmp and qq.bmp images, it takes a while in greyscale reconstruction with Solution 1.
(5) The detection results marked with white boxes are the detection results obtained by adding multi-feature constraints, all white plus black boxes are the results without multi-feature constraints, and the black boxes are the false ship targets.
